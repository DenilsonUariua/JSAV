<h1>Shellsort Tutorial</h1>
</div>

<p>
Shellsort was named after its inventor, D.L. Shell.
It is also sometimes called the <b>diminishing increment</b> sort.
Unlike Insertion Sort and Selection Sort, there is no real-life
intuition to inspire Shellsort - nobody will use Shellsort to
sort their Bridge hand or organize their bills.
But when properly implemented, Shellsort will give
substantially better performance than any of the &theta;(n<sup>2</sup>) 
sorts.
Unlike the exchange sorts (Insertion Sort and Bubble Sort),
Shellsort makes comparisons and swaps between non-adjacent elements.
Shellsort also exploits the best-case performance of Insertion Sort.
Shellsort's strategy is to quickly make the list ``mostly sorted''
so that a final Insertion Sort can finish the job.

<p>
Shellsort uses a process that forms the basis most good sorts:
Break the list into sublists, sort them, then recombine the sublists.
Shellsort does this in an unusual way, breaking its input
into ``virtual'' sublists.
Each sublist is sorted using an Insertion Sort.
Another group of sublists is then chosen and sorted, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Shellsort's driving inspiration is to take advantage of the fact that
Insertion Sort works very well when the list is nearly sorted.
(When the list is nearly sorted, Insertion sort works in linear time.)
Shellsort works by performing a series of Insertion Sorts on carefully
selected sublists, first on small sublists and then on increasingly
large sublists.
</p>

<p>
Shellsort breaks the list into disjoint sublists, where a sublist
is defined by an "increment."
Each element in a sublist is "increment" positions apart.
For example, if the increment were 4, then each element in the sublist
would be 4 positions apart.
In our examples, we assume for convenience that <i>n</i>,
the number of values to be sorted, is a power of two.
</p>

<p>
One possible implementation of Shellsort will begin by breaking the
list into <i>n</i>/2 sublists of 2 elements each, where the array
index of the 2 elements in each sublist differs by <i>n</i>/2.
That is, the increment is <i>n</i>/2.
If there are 16 elements in the array indexed from 0
to 15, there would initially be 8 sublists of 2 elements each, with
each element in the sublist being 8 positions apart.
The first sublist would be the elements in positions 0 and 8.
The second is in positions 1 and 9, and so on.
Click on the slideshow buttons to see the series of sublists of size
two.
</p>

<div id="container1">
  <span class="jsavcounter"></span>
  <a class="jsavsettings" href="#">Settings</a>
  <div class="jsavcontrols"></div>
</div>

<script>
(function($) {
  var av = new JSAV("container1");
  av.SPEED = speed; // Set the animation speed base
  // Create an array object under control of JSAV library
  var arr = av.ds.array(theArray, {indexed: true});

  // set color to LIGHT for the whole array, then highlight indices 0 and 8
  arr.css(function(index)
    { return index%8 != 0;}, {"color": LIGHT}).highlight([0, 8]);
  // another way to specify a message for a step
  av.step();
  arr.unhighlight([0, 8]).css([0, 8], {"color": LIGHT}).highlight([1, 9]);
  
  av.step();
  for (var i=2; i<8; i++) { // loop through the rest of the array sublists
    av.step();
    arr.unhighlight([i-1, i+7]).css([i-1, i+7], {"color": LIGHT}).highlight([i, i+8]);
  }
  av.recorded();
})(jQuery);
</script>

<p>
Now, each of these sublists of length two gets sorted using Insertion
Sort.
As you click through the slideshow, you will first see the current
sublist highlighted in yellow.
Then a pair of elements to be compared will be shown in blue.
They are swapped if necessary to put them in sort order.
</p>

<div id="container2">
  <span class="jsavcounter"></span>
  <a class="jsavsettings" href="#">Settings</a>
  <div class="jsavcontrols"></div>
</div>

<script>
(function($) {
  var arr = theArray;
  DoSweep("container2", arr, 8);
})(jQuery);
</script>


<p>
At the end of the first pass, the resulting array is "a little better
sorted".
</p>

<div id="container3">
</div>

<script>
(function($) {
  var arr = theArray2;
  ShowDifference("container3", arr);
})(jQuery);
</script>

<p>
The second pass of Shellsort looks at fewer, bigger lists.
For our example the second pass would have <i>n</i>/4 lists of size 4,
with the increment being <i>n</i>/4 = 4.
Thus, the second pass would have as its first
sublist the 4 elements in positions 0, 4, 8, and 12.
The second sublist would have elements in positions 1, 5, 9, and 13,
and so on.
As you click through the slides, you will see the sublists for
increment 4.
</p>

<div id="container4">
  <span class="jsavcounter"></span>
  <a class="jsavsettings" href="#">Settings</a>
	<div class="jsavcontrols"></div>
</div>

<script>
(function($) {
  var av = new JSAV("container4");
  av.SPEED = speed; // Set the animation speed base

  var arr = av.ds.array(theArray2, {indexed: true});

  arr.css(function(index)
    { return index%4 != 0;}, {"color": LIGHT}).highlight([0, 4, 8, 12]);

  av.step();
  arr.unhighlight([0, 4, 8, 12]).css([0, 4, 8, 12], {"color": LIGHT}).highlight([1, 5, 9, 13]);

  av.step();
  arr.unhighlight([1, 5, 9, 13]).css([1, 5, 9, 13], {"color": LIGHT}).highlight([2, 6, 10, 14]);

  av.step();
  arr.unhighlight([2, 6, 10, 14]).css([2, 6, 10, 14], {"color": LIGHT}).highlight([3, 7, 11, 15]);

  av.recorded();
})(jQuery);
</script>

<p>
Each sublist of four elements would also be sorted using an Insertion
Sort, as shown next.
</p>

<div id="container5">
  <span class="jsavcounter"></span>
  <a class="jsavsettings" href="#">Settings</a>
	<div class="jsavcontrols"></div>
</div>

<script>
(function($) {
  var arr = theArray2;
  DoSweep("container5", arr, 4);
})(jQuery);
</script>

<p>
At the end of processing sublists with increment 4, the array is
"even more sorted".
</p>

<div id="container6">
</div>

<script>
(function($) {
  var arr = theArray3;
  ShowDifference("container6", arr);
})(jQuery);
</script>

<p>
The third pass would be made on sublists with increment 2.
The effect is that we process two lists, one consisting of the odd
positions and the other consisting of the even positions.
As usual, we sort the sublists using Insertion Sort.
</p>

<div id="container7">
  <span class="jsavcounter"></span>
  <a class="jsavsettings" href="#">Settings</a>
	<div class="jsavcontrols"></div>
</div>

<script>
(function($) {
  var arr = theArray3;
  DoSweep("container7", arr, 2);
})(jQuery);
</script>

<p>
At this point, we are getting close to sorted.
</p>

<div id="container8">
</div>

<script>
(function($) {
  var arr = theArray4;
  ShowDifference("container8", arr);
})(jQuery);
</script>

<p>
The culminating pass for Shellsort will always use an increment of 1,
which means a "normal" Insertion Sort of all elements.
</p>

<div id="container9">
  <span class="jsavcounter"></span>
  <a class="jsavsettings" href="#">Settings</a>
	<div class="jsavcontrols"></div>
</div>

<script>
(function($) {
  var arr = theArray4;
  DoSweep("container9", arr, 1);
})(jQuery);
</script>

<p>
Finally, the array is sorted.
</p>

<input type="button" name="ex1" value="Exercise 1"
style="background-color:#f00;"/>

<script>
  // Support for "Exercise 1" button
  $('input[name="ex1"]').click(ex1); // Set callback action
  function ex1() { // This is what we pop up
    var mystring = "Given a random array of size n, a random increment size I <= n/2, and a random start location S, 0<=S<I (with an arrow over position S), click to highlight the array elements that should be in this sublist. Solve this exercise 10 times in a row to get credit.";
    alert(mystring);
    this.style.background='#0f0';
  }
</script>

<p>
Some choices for the series of increments will make Shellsort
run more efficiently than others.
In particular, the choice of increments described above (2<sup>k</sup>,
2<sup>k-1</sup>, ..., 4, 2, 1) turns out to be relatively inefficient.
You should notice for example that all elements in a given 8 increment
sublist are also part of some 4 increment sublist, which are all in turn
elements of the same 2 increment sublist.
So there is no "crossover" between sublists as the increments
reduce.
A better choice is the following series based on "3<i>n</i>+1":
(..., 121, 40, 13, 4, 1).
Another approach is to make sure that the various increments are
relatively prime.
The series (..., 11, 7, 3, 1) would be an example.
In this case, there is a lot of "crossover" between the lists at the
various increment sizes.
At the end of this unit is a tool that lets you see how much
difference in cost results when you change the increment series.
</p>

<input type="button" name="ex2" value="Exercise 2"
style="background-color:#f00;"/>

<script>
  // Support for "Exercise 2" button
  $('input[name="ex2"]').click(ex2); // Set callback action
  function ex2() { // This is what we pop up
    var mystring = "A proposed increment series is generated and displayed. TRUE or FALSE: This is a legal series of increments for Shellsort. The exercise must be solved correctly 10 times in a row to get credit.";
    alert(mystring);
    this.style.background='#0f0';
  }
</script>

<p>
At this point, try running Shellsort on an array of your chosen size,
with either random values or values that you select.
You can also set the increment series.
Use this tool to make sure that you understand how Shellsort works.

Can you reproduce its behavior?

<p>
Now you are ready to try out some different increment series to see
how they affect the cost of Shellsort.

<p>
A theoretical analysis of Shellsort is difficult, so we must accept
without proof that the average-case performance of Shellsort
(for the ``3<i>n</i>+1''increment series such as ..., 13, 4, 1)
is O(n&radic;n).
Other choices for the increment
series can reduce this upper bound somewhat.
Thus, Shellsort is substantially better than Insertion Sort,
or any of the other &theta;(n<sup>2</sup>) sorts presented earlier.
In fact, Shellsort is not so much worse than the
asymptotically better sorts to be presented whenever <i>n</i> is of medium
size (thought is tends to be a little slower than these other
algorithms when they are well implemented).
Shellsort illustrates how we can sometimes exploit the special properties
of an algorithm (in this case Insertion Sort) even if in general that
algorithm is unacceptably slow.
